    "# Introduzione\n",
    "\n",
    "[SpaCy](spacy.io) è una libreria open-source gratuita per il Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python. Può essere usata per costruire sistemi di Information Extractrion o di Comprensione del Linguaggio Naturale, o anche per fare preprocessamento di testo per il Deep Learning.  \n",
    "Alcune caratteristiche di SpaCy sono:\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: suddividere il testo in unità indivisibili (**token**), formate dalle singole parole, segni di punteggiatura, simboli come 35% ecc.\n",
    "- **Part-of-speech (POS) Tagging**: Assegnare i tipi delle parole (nome, verbo) ai token.\n",
    "- **Dependency Parsing**: Assegnare delle etichette di dipendenza sintattica che descrivono le relazioni tra i diversi token. Ad esempio un token è oggetto mentre un altro è il soggetto.\n",
    "- **Lemmatization**: Convertire le parole nella loro forma base, in italiano nel lemma. Ad esempio la forma all'infinto dei verbi oppure la forma maschile singolare dei nomi. In inglese, il lemma di “was” è “be”, e il lemma di “rats” è “rat”.\n",
    "- **Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD)**: Trovare e suddividere i testi nelle diverse frasi.\n",
    "- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Trovare ed etichettare gli oggetti del mondo reale che hanno un nome, ad esempio persone, compagnie o luoghi. \"New York City\", \"Giovanni\" sono delle Named Entities.\n",
    "- **Entity Linking (EL)**: Disambiguare le entità testuali in modo da assegnargli degli identificatori univoci in una base di conoscenza.\n",
    "- **Similarity**: Confrontare le parole, testi e documenti e fornire una misura di similarità tra loro.\n",
    "- **Text Classification**: Assegnare delle categorie o etichette a interi documenti o parti di esso.\n",
    "- **Rule-based Matching**: Trovare le sequenze di token in base alle loro annotazioni linguistiche, in modo simile alle Regular Expression.\n",
    "- **Training**: Aggiornare e migliorare le predizioni di un modello statistico\n",
    "- **Serialization**: Salvare gli oggetti su file o su stringhe di bytes."
